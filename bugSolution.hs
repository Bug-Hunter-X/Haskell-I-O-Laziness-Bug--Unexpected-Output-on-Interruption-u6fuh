The solution involves using `hFlush` to ensure all output is written before the program exits:

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering
  contents <- getLine
  putStrLn ("You entered:" ++ contents)
  putStrLn "This line should now print even if the program is killed"
  hFlush stdout
```

By adding `hFlush stdout`, we explicitly force the contents of the standard output buffer to be written to the console, resolving the issue.
