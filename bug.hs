This Haskell code suffers from a subtle bug related to lazy evaluation and the interaction with I/O operations.

```haskell
import System.IO

main :: IO ()
main = do
  hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering -- Enable unbuffered output
  contents <- getLine
  putStrLn ("You entered:" ++ contents)
  putStrLn "This line might not print immediately if the program is killed" 
```

The problem arises if the program is interrupted (e.g., using Ctrl+C) before the final `putStrLn` completes. Because Haskell's I/O is lazy, the second `putStrLn` might not have been executed yet, resulting in the last line never being printed to the console.
